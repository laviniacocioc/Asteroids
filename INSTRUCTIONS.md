Asteroids Game Implementation
In this project, I developed the classic Asteroids game by building on an empty program template and progressively implementing the required features.

Part 1: Game Window, Ship Creation, and Turning
I started by setting up the basic game environment, which involved creating the game window, rendering the player's ship, and implementing the functionality to allow the ship to turn. Once this part was working, I updated the partsCompleted method in the AsteroidsApplication class to return 1.

Part 2: Ship Movement
Next, I added functionality for moving the ship, allowing it to thrust forward and navigate the game space. With the ship movement and turning fully functional, I updated the partsCompleted method to return 2.

Part 3: Asteroids and Collisions
I then extended the game by introducing asteroids. This included creating an asteroid, handling collisions between the ship and asteroids, and adding multiple asteroids into the game world. After implementing these features, I updated the partsCompleted method to return 3.

Part 4: Projectiles, Points, and Game Mechanics
In the final part, I completed the remaining core functionalities of the game. I ensured that objects stay within the game window, implemented projectile shooting from the ship, added a points system, and made it so new asteroids spawn when existing ones are destroyed. With all of these elements in place, I set the partsCompleted method to return 4.
